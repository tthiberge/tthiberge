### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm ThÃ©o and after 5 years working in Paris, FR as a Real-estate & Construction consultant, I'm following a career change in tech in order to serve firms sharing my values and committment! âœ¨

I've gratuated from Le Wagon bootcamp in March 2023 :mortar_board: and I'm looking forward to working in an amazing company that is:
- people-driven :busts_in_silhouette: 
- ecology-enthusiastic ðŸŒ±
- tech-lover :computer: 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal tech projects: continuing the development of my bootcamp project, recreating amazing features seen online, or helping friends with their webapps / websites!

ðŸ’¬ If you like my work or want to discuss or collaborate, feel free to contact me! ðŸ“«

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a certified Yoga Instructor and I have a Nutrition Science certificate from Stanford University!
Love these topics! :yum:
